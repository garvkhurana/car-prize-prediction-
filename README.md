Car Price Prediction with Random Forest

This project implements a machine learning model to predict the price of used cars using the Random Forest algorithm.
Project Overview

This project aims to develop a model that can estimate the selling price of a used car based on various features such as:

    Make and Model
    Year
    Engine specifications
    Transmission type
    Features and options

By utilizing the Random Forest algorithm, the model can learn complex relationships between these features and car prices.
Dependencies

This project requires the following Python libraries:

    pandas
    numpy
    scikit-learn
    seaborn
    matplotlib

You can install them using the following command:
Bash

pip install pandas numpy scikit-learn

Use code with caution.
Usage

    Clone the repository:

Bash

git clone https://<your_repository_url>

Use code with caution.

    Navigate to the project directory:

Bash

cd car-price-prediction

Use code with caution.

    Run the script:

Bash

python car-price-prediction.py

Use code with caution.

This script will:

    Load and pre-process the car data.
    Train the Random Forest model.
    Evaluate the model performance.
    Save the trained model.

     Prediction:

You can use the saved model to predict the price of a new car by providing its features as input to the model. (Implementation details will depend on your chosen script structure)
